                            <p> Either this: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MRNDVV3/ Or this: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01NARDDTI/ MAINLY FOR SCHOOL Welcome, I want to start program in C#. I wanted to install Visual Studio 2013 Community, but there's one problem: I cant install program because of this error. My OS: Windows 7 64 bit //screen from installing VS2012 express, but when I install VS2013 community there's the same error. Hello, I’m trying to install Microsoft Community Visual Studio 2013 Edition after downloading .exe file from the website. Due to my slow internet, I tried to install it in phases. But when I resume it by clicking install button it started again from the beginning. The total package is 10 GB. And if I’d try like normal procedure my computer has to be on for some days to complete the installation. If I’d download it by IDM, download breaks after few hours (resume is not working). Is there 
I have downloaded and installed the cppcheck binary from here ( and installed the Cppcheck VS add-in from here (https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/80bc51e4-2c27-45b6-85e2-de9b59167f5b). But when I click on Tools->Check current project with cppcheck, the VS console output under "Cppcheck analysis results" is empty. What could be the problem? Or does it mean that the analysis completed successfully and there are no problems in the solution? I would. Update 2016-05-30 - Since I don't get the time I will now upload the whole PSMove Code from my HDD as an archive. Feel free to download, cleanup up and upload on your name. It was packed directly from drive C: ,so you can unpack directly there and use Visual Studio 2013 Community. This should work. - Feel free to ask questions here. - Link (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bye7vvW1JTGCSFpCVU8zaWhtWEE) Update 2016-05-12 - Added Github-Link for SteamVR Plugin. After years of using Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition successfully, as of this morning it crashes on open. No updates or changes were made to the machine since last night when it was working just fine. I'm not attempting to open some specific project or perform a particular operation. Some have suggested that problem can be resolved with the /resetuserdata flag. This does indeed eliminate the crash but I'm then presented with the "your 30-day trial has expired" error with an option If, and only if, you MUST run Windows 10 and still want decent performance running Theano & Keras, the following guide may help. It describes GPU acceleration on Windows 10 in native mode -- no VMs, no Docker: https://github.com/philferriere/dlwin We tested it on the following hardware: - Dell Precision T7500, 96BG RAM Intel Xeon E5605 @ 2.13 GHz (2 processors, 8 cores total) - NVIDIA GeForce Titan X, 12GB RAM Driver version: 10.18.13.5390 Beta (ForceWare 353.90) So, for the last couple of weeks I've been working on writing a Windows kernel driver for the Nintendo Gamecube Adapter. I was inspired by the works of ToadKing (https://github.com/ToadKing/wii-u-gc-adapter) for Linux and our own /u/elmassivo (https://bitbucket.org/elmassivo/gcn-usb-adapter). It currently supports all four controllers and exposes them as USB game controllers for Windows. For those who just want to see the driver, I have uploaded the source code to GitHub (https://github.com/gem. I was trying to avoid needing a database for a project I'm working on, but now I'm at the point where I feel I can't move forward without one. I have an MVC application in Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition  which database should I go with? I have tons of experience with SQL Server and Oracle, but would rather not spend that kind of money. EDIT: 3/15 Just wanted to add that for a living I am a software developer, writing MVC applications using SQL Server as a back end. This is a project. Somewhat new to ffmpeg development, as in wanting to use the various av .libs from ffmpeg in my own software, I followed the steps outlined here to compile from source: System: Win10, x64, Visual Studio 2013 Community. I can compile as outlined there fine, but the generated libraries have a .dll.a extension, and I suspect that's not right. I've seen a configure option "--toolchain" that might 
New PC, new Windows. Trying to install Theano. I installed Visual Studio 14 Community version, then CUDA 7.5. Now this page is telling me that I need Visual Studio 2010 together with Microsoft Windows SDK for 32bit + 64bit (the linked SDK is for Windows 7.). The installation doc is referring to pretty old versions, is this still the only way to go or have things become simpler? I am pretty unexperienced with development on Windows. Hello Reddit, I am curious, because I'm wanting to make a turn based rpg from the ground up, building the engine and everything, how would I go about that, as in, what language should I use, and where would I find the information to get started. My current budget is absolutely 0, and I'm coding using entirely free software (primarly microsoft visual studio 2013 community, and I have some experience making text based adventure games in python). I'm wanting to create something with a visual interf. Can I use Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate to enable planets and 64bit and compile the game without errors? I mean is it compatible? Because on GitHub it says the following: Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition with Update 4 or different version of VS2013 with Update. If it does, I can't get it to work. It only sees C# scripts. I'm using Unity 5, Visual Studio 2013 Community, and Visual Studio 2013 Tools for Unity version 1.9.9.0. I want to download Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition. I tried initiating the download and exiting chrome, but that cancels the download. There's no official torrent. The only torrent on Piratebay and Kickass for the Community Edition have speeds in bits/second. Any safe way of ensuring my download does not fail, my downloaded files are not corrupted/deleted, and I can pause and resume my download at any point. I am totally new to Qt so I am a little confused as to exactly what I need to download. On the Qt download page ( there are a few options for Windows but I am not too sure which I should get. I figure it is one of the following but I can't find a detailed explanation of which one. The choices are - Qt 5.4.1 for Windows 64-bit (VS 2013, 722 MB) Qt 5.4.1 for Windows 64-bit (VS 2013, OpenGL, 711 MB) Qt 5.4.1 for Windows 32-bit (MinGW 4.9.1
