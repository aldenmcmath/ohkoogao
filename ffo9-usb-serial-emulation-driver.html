                            <p>Strange question , I have a legacy program with no further updates on the way, it was designed to connect to a rs232 port on either com port 1-3 (and no other) Its now connecting via usb and Com ports 1-4 are already assigned and cant be changed so windows assigns ports above that. on previous windows you could re-assign a port to a connection but alas that option has been removed  Was wondering apart from dual booting an old version of windows has anyone a solution or an option i could. I was recently working on a project where serial was being used to communicate between a Raspberry Pi and a Mbed lpc1768. It turns out characters were randomly being dropped and nothing could entirely eliminate the issue. Lowering the Baud below 1000 showed an improvement in reliability, yet the issue remained. Sometimes, the Pi could not find the Mbed at all as a device, even though the Mbed appeared to function as normal. I suspect there is an issue with the devices not getting enough power.

Hi, As probably shown by my previous Reddit posts, I'm still struggling with my mouse issue. My mouse randomly stops working ( it feels like power to mouse gets cut off for less than a second ) The game I play will still run smooth, with good fps. Task manager will not show any changes whilst the mouse does not respond. procressor, memmory, disc, network, gpu are all very stable. Temperatures are perfectly fine. I've tried googling every single. Hey, So I was on my laptop, the only bluetooth device I use is a mouse, I was browsing internet and the mouse stopped working. here's all the info I could get : /etc/init.d/bluetooth status ● bluetooth.service - Bluetooth service Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Tue 2018-12-25 19:26:08 CET; 3min 20s ago Docs: man:bluetoothd(8) Main PID: 3886 (bluetoothd). I'm currently having this issue on Gentoo. When I connect it using USB everything works fine. But when I try it over bluetooth it dosn't seem to work. Sometimes I can get it to stay connected but even then it still won't work. Here is the output of dmesg immediatly after trying to connect the controller: 14.855175 snd_hda_codec_generic hdaudioC0D2: autoconfig for Generic: line_outs=0 (0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0) type:line 14.855179 snd_hda_codec_generic hdaudioC0D2: speaker_outs=. So, I've gotten past DDR stress test and calibration, boot loader (u-boot), i've got a working parallel 24-bit LCD (actually going through ser-des via LVDS because I need to capacitively couple through HV barrier); so everything is going great, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why the kernel is hanging. It was hanging on crypto caam so i disabled everthing with crypto caam in imx\_v7\_defconfig but now it's hanging on this dns thing. I think I need to somehow disable the hardwired. 
Well, it seems like libinput is not working properly.Therefor i don't have any input on Xorg-server. $ libinput Error loading shared library libinput.so.10: Exec format error (needed by /usr/bin/libinput) Error loading shared library libevdev.so.2: Exec format error (needed by /usr/bin/libinput) Error relocating /usr/bin/libinput: libinput_device_config_scroll_set_method: symbol not found Error relocating /usr/bin/libinput: libinput_log_set_handler: symbol not found. Using NXP's i.mx6ul processor, custom board based on the eval board. I'm stuck at the kernel message "Key type dns\_resolver registered". My SD card appears to be fine, bootloader is fine, I have an image on my LCD, there are no obvious error messages in my boot log (see attached). I've used multiple file systems -- a minimal build with busybox, a version from buildroot, my own rootfs built with linaro, the demo version that comes with the eval board -- none of that helps. I've done everythin. Good morning folks, I have an Antminer S9 that has performed flawlessly. After I moved it to a better location, I noticed that it no longer seems to be working. The green light is flashing, but it doesn't seem to be hashing to my pool (Nicehash). I'm fairly new to Bitcoining mining and can't make sense of some of the information on my status screen. Before I jump into Bitmain support, I was wondering if anyone could clue me in as to what the problem might be. https://s. Not sure if anyone can help me with this, but here goes. So a while ago I found a Color Stylewriter at a junk shop for like , thought I'd buy it and play around. I got new ink for it and paper, it powers up fine, no error messages, etc. This printer uses a serial connection, so to use it with my iBook G3 I bought this (https://www.amazon.com/Keyspan-USA-28x-External-Serial-Adapter/dp/B0000513JR) I installed the drivers for it and followed the manual to set it up for use with a serial. Hello, all! My computer decided to randomly shut down the other day while I was playing Fallout 4. I turned it back on and everything seemed normal, but when I booted up Chrome, the computer died again. Both times the code it posted was that it had detected a power surge, and shut off. The computer then had difficulty turning back on again, or powering all the devices. This loop continued until I shut it down completely, figuring it to be a PSU problem. I ordered a new one off Amazon So I am having some issues getting a monitor I purchased on ebay setup Link (https://www.ebay.com/itm/-/253778150557?nordt=true&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l10137) It connects and works fine with the execption of a few issues. The touch screen operates as if it is rotated 90deg. clockwise (I touch bottom left, it clicks top left. I click top left, it clicks top right. ect.) I have tried to correct this using xinput\_calibrator with an output of. `Section "InputCla. Not hashing at all here is the kernal log, my other s9 works great but this thing seems to be broken even before being plugged in. Any idea what's wrong if its an ez fix?

# MAME 0.186 ( It’s been one of those long, five-week development cycles, but it’s finally time for your monthly MAME fix. There’s been a lot of touched in this release, with improvements in a number of areas. But before we get to the improvements, we have an embarrassing admission to make: the game added in 0.185 as Acchi Muite Hoi is actually Pata Pata Panic, and the sound ROM mapping was incorrect, making the game unplayable. That’s all sorted out now though # MAME 0.185 ( Today’s the day for our April MAME release, bringing some important fixes as well as the usual assortment of emulation improvements. A bug preventing multiple keys from being mapped to subdevice inputs has been fixed, which means you can now assign multiple keys to buttons in NeoGeo games and consoles/computers with controller/keyboard/mouse slots. Software loading has been reworked in this release, and the user-visible issues in 0.184 should be addre. ALL CREDIT goes to SBC-Studios (whose guide I used as a template), chatdeau, Rockey12, the makers of the kexts, and ZoroZZ all of the Insanely Mac Forums, plus many users on the Corpnewt Discord Server. Thank you all on discord for putting up with me. Also thanks to Corpnewt, Macmiester, and all the people who have asked questions, used this guide, and helped in various forums. I suggest that you use the Insanely Mac Forums (guides are linked in this document) combined with Tonymacx86 Hey Guys, Have an L3+, stopped hashing, and Fault light was tripped. The fans just spool up and down like it won't connect to a pool and with that it won't connect to any pools. Was wondering if anyone could read the Kernel Log and let me know if anything jumps out at you as to being off. I have changed PSU's I have rebooted, and reset. All I can think now is that the firmware needs to be reinstalled. Sorry for the log being so long. 0.000000 Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0 0.000. Some possibly-useless info for y'all in case it helps anyone debug things, or helps decide on a purchase of this (so far so great!) device are listed below. So far almost literally everything has worked (haven't tested bluetooth or fingerprint reader). Wireless, trackpad, trackpoint (including scroll - see below), backlight (both screen and keyboard), the mute lights on the keyboard, suspend/resume (have not tested this after a USB-C device plug/unplug, which is something that would kernel panic. I initially posted this in r/raspberry_pi, but I can no longer find it, and it didn't show up in my RSS feed, so perhaps it will be more visible and welcome here. Also, I was able to update it slightly due to improved fonts in Aeon MQ7. ---- Here is what I did to set up a Pi2 and a Pi3 as media centers in my home. I used a Linux PC for any work with the SD Cards or `ssh`. These steps can be improved, but they got things working pretty well for me. I wanted to share what I learned. Hello gentoomen, I am transitioning from Arch to Gentoo on my new rig and with the combination of systemd ~~+ LUKS/LVM~~, and being my first time, I knew this would get confusing so I spent some time trying to plan it out. Now I ask of you to peer review it and help me ascend on my glorious journey, if you see any errors/mistakes and any suggestions or recommendations are welcome. Thank you. _____________ ##This is for: UEFI, Ethernet, ~~Luks on~~ LVM, and systemd. #PCI & USB devices:. </p>
